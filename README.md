### Color design
For the colour palette i chose three colors dirived from the companies main logo, to try to give it a clear vibrant image which i hope will provoke a passionate response from the viewer and create a clear contrast  to help engagement and readablity. 
Color palette :
#000000 as the main background color so as to provide a nice contrast to help readability.
#ffee00 for active link and the majority of the text;
#db1d0d for links and the color of the main background logo.
rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.6)  ist the colour used behind bodies of text so as to improve readability further.

### Typography
I chose Montserrat and Montserrat Subrayada as i liked the many options of font weight these allowed and also because the are clear professional looking fonts with a little character. Tey were imported from Google Fonts.
Features

I want the website to be original, engaging, simple, direct and easy to use. It is very important that the user is not overwhelmed be information so i make if a goal to have just the right amount of pages with just the right amount of information on each with the option to contact the website client for questions or more information if they wish.
All pages except the welcome page will be structurally similar. At the top of each page there will be a fixed response navigation bar that will indicate clearly to the user which page they are currently viewing and a change when they hover over the navigation menu containing links to other pages indicating acitve links. The user experience should be energised by the simple colour choices and the easy to navigate page structure.Each page will contain its social links in the footer of the page with simple icons clearliy defined. This navigation bar will collapse on mobile devices to show only the hamburger menu icon which will be aligned to the right corner of each page.
Research has been done on many other website on the internet, looking at other businesses, comedy clubs, venues, promotional companies. 
The background image design, logo design, tab icon were all designed by Barry Cullen using the open source software GIMP.
### Current Features
Website allows the user to:
Find out more about the Comedy Club
The gallery page lets you see images of past shows and Watch a select videos of comedians on stage
On the footer of every page there are social medai links to the Club's social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram) 
Live shows - allows users to see upcoming events clearly by using a calender and to book tickets.
Contact form – so users of the website can ask questions or submit enquiries, 
easily facilated by filling out a minimalistic user-friendly contact form.

### Additional features to add
To intergrate Eventbrite's embedded checkout into the page itself rather than being a link to there site which i believe interupts the user experience of my site.
This would be done after obtaining a HTTPS certificate.
A pop up modal to become a member of our community.
A Merch page and checkout cart system to buy and pay for merchandise.
