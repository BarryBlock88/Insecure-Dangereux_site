## This project (Milestone one) was completed as part of Code Institute's Full Stack Web Development course in 2020/21-

## Project Requirements:
-To create a frontend user-centric website with HTML5, CSS3 with the possible addition of frameworks such as Bootstrap.-


## Project Outline:
#### Insecure & Dangereux: Comedy Nights

- Insecure and Dangereux: Comedy Nights is a Comedy club specialising in English language Live stand up and improv events, throughout venues in Brussels, Belgium.

- It is an actual comedy club based in Brussels, that I founded, though various elements are real and others are fake adopted from multiple sources where credited.


- The Website begins as a straightforward presentation. To help keep the eye focused, the site only uses three colours and an edit made of the primary company logo with one line of text to inform the use of each page. 

- Each page will feature the company logo.

- three of the pages will have button to purchase tickets.

- Each page will contain a footer with four social links 

- There are 5-page links located on the Navbar.
    - Homepage that contains the company name, what they do and below that any recent News or updates.
    - Live shows in this instance is the home page and it tells us when the next show is happening along with a small paragraph about the page it also contains a few lines on each of our venues. News is an area with articles about the Club and recent updates.
    - Gallery includes photos of past shows. (planning to use a bootstrap carousel code snippet for this feature in future versions.)
    - About us is a page giving a section on our history of the Club and the people involved in the setup and running of the Club.
    - Contact contains information on the location of our offices, email, phone number and an enquiry form for any questions a user may have.




## *UX*
#### Who is the target audience of this site?

The site is targeted at current fans of the Insecure & Dangereux, comedy-lovers looking to discover live shows in there city and those interested in performing at one of the comedy open mics. I imagine users visiting the site through there phone and laptop primarily.

“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].” 
### User Stories
- As a user discovering the Website for the first time. I want to be able to have a sense of the energy behind the show; I want to see great photos from past shows to be inspired to attend a show. I want to book tickets easily so I can go to a show when I feel like it.
- As a potential performer, I want to easily contact the Club through there Website, social media links or email. I want them to be easy to find and obvious to the eye. So that I can perform in a future show.
- As a fan of Insecure & Dangereux's live shows, I want to keep up to date on what shows are happening and how venue with user-friendly calendar of events colour coded by the venue. I want to be able to book tickets easily. So that I never miss a show.
- As a mobile user, I want to be able to scroll through the content easily, I want it to fit my phones screen size to allow me to read it easily and to be able to return to the top of the page quickly. So that is a pleasantly intuitive experience and will use again.
- As a desktop user, I want to see an engaging, colourful website with images from past shows and info on future ones. I want to Navbar to be responsive when I hover my mouse over it, and I want to know what page is active. So that I am engaged in using the Website more in future.

I want potential performers to easily contact us about future shows to build a community of comedians.   I want to make it easy to inform our fans of upcoming shows and events. I want to engage with our current fans to keep them coming back. I want to make it a responsive, engaging experience on mobile and desktop devices.

### Colour design
For the colour palette, I chose three colours derived from the companies' main logo to try to give it a clear, vibrant image that will provoke a passionate response from the viewer and create a clear contrast to help engagement and readability. 

#### Colour palette :

- #000000 as the primary background colour to provide a nice contrast to help readability.
- #ffee00 for an active link and the majority of the text;
- #db1d0d for links and the colour of the main background logo.
- RGB(7, 7, 7, 0.6)  ist the colour used behind bodies of text to further improve readability.

### Typography
I chose Montserrat and Montserrat Subrayada as I liked the many font-weight options these allowed and because they are clear professional-looking fonts with a little character. The fonts were imported from Google Fonts.

## *Features*

- I want the Website to be original, engaging, simple, direct and easy to use. The user mustn't be overwhelmed with information, so I make a goal to have just the right amount of pages with just the right amount of information on each with the option to contact the website client for questions or more information if they wish.

- All pages except the welcome page will be structurally similar. At the top of each page, a fixed responsive navigation bar will indicate clearly to the user which page they are currently viewing and a change when they hover over the navigation menu containing links to other pages displaying active links. The user experience should be energised by the simple colour choices and the easy to navigate page structure. Each page will contain its social links in the footer of the page with simple icons clearly defined. This navigation bar will collapse on mobile devices to show only the hamburger menu icon, aligned to each page's top-left corner.

- Research has been done on many other websites on the internet, looking at other businesses, comedy clubs, venues, promotional companies. 

- The background image design, logo design, tab icon were all designed by Barry Cullen using the open-source software GIMP.

### Current Features
##### Website allows the user to - 

- *Home page - has recent news and title text and book tickets option which continues on each page.
- _Gallery page_ - lets you see images of past shows and Watch select videos of comedians on stage
- On the *footer* of every page there are social media links to the Club's social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram) 
*Live shows page* - allows users to see upcoming events on a calendar, showing upcoming show info and enabling them to book tickets for a show.
- *Contact form* – so users of the Website can ask questions or submit enquiries, 
    easily facilitated by filling out a minimalistic user-friendly contact form.

### Additional features to add
To integrate Eventbrite's embedded checkout into the page itself rather than link to their site, I believe interrupts my site's user experience.
This could be done after obtaining an HTTPS certificate.
- A form so comedians can become a member of our community.
- A Merch page and checkout cart system to buy and pay for merchandise.
- I would like to make the calendar more dynamic using Javascript or Jquery.
- I would like to make the form submittable in future with PHP.
- I would like to include videos and photos using bootstrap carousel in future versions.

#### Responsiveness
The Website was viewed on devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Huawei Y6, iPhone 7/8, Samsung A1.
#### Browsers
The Website was tested on Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers. 
#### Issues Found
- Had difficuly styling the Table (calendar) with CSS for smaller screens, so decided to leave it out for screens under desktop/laptop size.
- Bootstrap with customisation was a challenge, but it worked out after some intensive research.
###### bugs
- The text on the primary nav in the mobile dropdown view did not show on some devices, but it became visible after hovering. 


## Deployment
The site was developed in GitPod and pushed to the following remote GitHub repository - (https://github.com/BarryBlock88/Insecure-Dangereux_site)
##### The following GIT commands were used throughout deployment:

1. git add. -to move files to the stage before commit. 
2. git commit - to commit the files in Gitpod, insert text on the main terminal instead of in brackets as in previous versions.
3. git push - to push the files to the master branch of your GitHub repository. 
4. git pull - on occasion when the push showed an error.


### Hosting on GitHub Pages
- This site is hosted on GitHub pages, deployed directly from the repositories master branch. - LIVE SITE
- The hosting process was completed via the following steps.
- Log into GitHub. 
- Choose the relevant repository  
- Go to settings of that repository (the far right tab)
- Scroll down to until you see GitHub Pages section. 
- Select as a source master branch, keep folder as Root and save.
- Your site will live in 3 to 10 minutes.
